-Work-.

I also used comlimentary colours black,pink and white.
I made the edges of the divs curved by a border radius of 10 pixels.
The divs are told a part by their class names; container for the parent div and content for the child div, and in each i added an h1 an p tags.

-Purpose of the task-.

The purpose or reason for this task is to understand the use and functionality of flexbox and the properties under it.

-Flexbox properties you used:.-

I used the main flexbox properties like: justify-content, flex-wrap ,align-items.

-Challenges faced.-
Found some difficulty in trying to split the divs and make them individules since i had put all the css style in the container class instead of adding the corresponding style to the child div, but I resolved the issue and managed to spit them accordingly
